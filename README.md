# Modelling Air Pollution
_Modelling Air Pollution using statistical, ML and DL models.

Air pollution cause massive damages to life with several pulmonary ailments. 
Thus, it is important to monitor air pollution levels in the atmosphere.
This project deals with the data collected using IoT sensors in the Mandi district for predicting air pollution levels (PM2.5, PM10, NOX, SO2, CO, and O3) using statistical and ML (or DL) based time-series forecasting methods.
